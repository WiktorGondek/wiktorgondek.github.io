Hello! I am a dedicated and resourceful individual with a passion for
scientific exploration and a keen eye for detail. As a recent graduate with an
Masters in Physics from the University of Warwick, my academic experiences have
equipped me with a strong foundation in computational physics, scientific
computing, and statistical physics.

During my time at University of Warwick, I completed a Master's project on
inclusive flavour tagging with data from LHCb at CERN. I also took the lead on
a Â£1500 funded research project focused on detecting high-frequency oscillation
modes in solar-like stars. These experiences allowed me to showcase my
proficiency in python programming, where I developed scripts for rigorous
analysis of time-series data. The culmination of my efforts resulted in an
abstract and an academic poster, which I presented at a showcase to my peers.

As a Mathematics Tutor with Action Tutoring, I had the opportunity to mentor
and enrich the mathematical proficiency of Year 5 students from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Leveraging online teaching tools, I created engaging educational
experiences, providing positive reinforcement to boost student confidence and
performance.
