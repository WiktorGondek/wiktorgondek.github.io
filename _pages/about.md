Hello! I am a dedicated and resourceful individual with a passion for technology and a keen eye for detail. As a recent Master of Physics graduate from the University of Warwick, my academic exeriences have provided me with knowledge across a wide range of fields within physics as well as skills in problem-solving and analytical thinking. My passion for technology has driven me to pursue modules in condensed matter physics as well as exploring computing, where I developed skills in programming in Python and C.

During my time at the University of Warwick, I completed a Master's project on optimising machine learning algorithms, utilising data from LHCb at CERN. I also took the lead on a Â£1500 funded research project focused on detecting high-frequency oscillation modes in solar-like stars. These experiences have provided me with skills in data analysis and working independently as well as within a team.

As a mathematics and physics tutor, organising lessons and explaining concepts clearly. This has taught me to efficiently communicate and adapt my teaching style to better suit the learner.

Overall, I am a curious, enthusiastic, and stay up to date with the latest trends in technology. I am eager to pursue a career where I can apply my strong computational skills and tackle complex problems to contribute to innovative projects.
